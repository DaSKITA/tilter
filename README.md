# tilter
Annotation tool _TILTer_ for the annotation and conversion of privacy policies into the [TILT schema](https://github.com/Transparency-Information-Language/schema).


## Run Application

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7.0 or above
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


### SetUp
#### Docker-Compose

1. Type `source ops/variables/local.txt`
2. Type `docker-compose up` in the Terminal Window.
3. Access [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and [http://localhost:5000/api/docs/](http://localhost:5000/api/docs/) in your favorite Browser


#### Local

This is a setup Guide for Ubuntu.

1. Create a Python Environment with `python -m venv <your-env-name>`
2. Activate your python environment with `source <your-env-name>/bin/activate`
3. Upgrade Pip with `python -m pip install -U pip` and install all necessary packages with `pip install -r app/requirements.txt`
4. Type `source ops/variables/local.txt`
5. Run the app with `./scripts/start_local.sh`


## Deployment

The TILTer ist currently deployed in a [google compute engine](http://34.89.190.55:5000/).
Deplyoment is not automated. Inside the engine the repository is clonded and has to be manually synched with
the remote repository. For access to the compute engine ask Michael, to provide you with the necessary
`ssh-keys` and Username.
The ssh-connection can be established via `ssh -i [Path_to_Private_Key] [USERNAME]@34.89.190.55`.
In the engine a log is created from the console output via nohub. All output is saved in `nohub.out` in the
root directory of the titler.

It is recommended to use screens for managing the application on the compute engine.
<br>
Start a new screen by: `screen -S <screen_name>`
<br>
Reattach a screen by: `screen -r <screen_name>`
<br>
See all screens with: `screen ls`

Deployment variables are stored seperately.

The deployment will be active for 90 days (from 31.05.2021) without any costs. Afterwards running the TILTer
will costs ~13 Euros per month.

The Deployment can be accessed under: http://34.89.190.55:5000


## Languages and Translations
Currently supported Languages are English (standard) and German. These are realized using the `pybabel` package. For more information regarding this topic please visit the [babel documentation](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/index.html).

### Adding New Languages
New languages are added using the `pybabel` command as follows:
1. Append the code for the new Language to the `LANGUAGES`-list in `config.py`. For available language codes check the [babel documentation](http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/index.html).
2. Add new text to be translated using the `_([text])` command, where `[text]` is the string to be translated.
3. Execute `pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o translations/messages.pot .` in `/app/`.
4. Execute `pybabel init -i translations/messages.pot -d translations -l [code]` in `app`, where `[code]` is the language code you chose in the first step.
5. Now add translations using `msgstr ""` entries in the file to `/app/translations/[code]/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`, where `[code]` again is the language code you chose in the first step.
6. Compile the changes using `pybabel compile -d translations` in `/app/`.
7. Restart the flask application via docker.

### Updating Existing Languages
When updating existing languages there is no need to follow the whole procedure above. Instead use the following steps:
1. Add new text to be translated using the `_([text])` command, where `[text]` is the string to be translated.
2. Execute `pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -o translations/messages.pot .` in `/app/`.
3. Execute `pybabel update -i translations/messages.pot -d translations` in `/app/`.
4. Now add translations using `msgstr ""` entries in the file to `/app/translations/[code]/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`, where `[code]` is the language code associated with the target language.
5. Compile the changes using `pybabel compile -d translations` in `/app/`.
6. Restart the flask application via docker.

### Creating a new labelling task
1. Visit http://tilter.implementation.cloud/api/docs.
2. **`POST`** `/auth` with your credentials and save your _apiKey_.

```json
{
  "username": "janedoe",
  "password": "rEyl3TuS4Qq"
}

```

4. Authorize in the upper right corner with your _apiKey_ (e.g. `eyJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsImlhdCI6MTYyNjUxOTA5OSwianRpIjoiM2Q0ODVkOGMtMmU4NS00OTg4LTk4YTEtNjlmYzI4NDI2MDgwIiwidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyIsInN1YiI6ImVsaWFzZ3J1ZW5ld2FsZCIsIm5iZiI6MTYyNjUxOTA5OSwiZXhwIjoxNjI2NTE5OTk5fQ`). Note: You need to generate a new one from time to time.
5. **`POST`** `/task/create` with

```json
{
  "name": "My Company",
  "text": "Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our websites, software, and services (\u201CServices\u201D). For more information and details, please see...",
  "html": false,
  "url": "https://mycompany.com/privacy"
}

```

Tip: Use https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html to escape your `text` for correct json representation.

5. Check the task list at http://tilter.implementation.cloud/tasks.
6. Visit your created task and label all subtasks.
7. Retrieve the resulting tilt document via http://tilter.implementation.cloud/api/task/:id/tilt where `:id` is something like `60d08460e26c9b911f6c81aa` depending on your task.
